###This is my idea and entire workflow of the project 
1. User Onboarding
Step 1: User Access

The user accesses the system via a mobile app, web portal, or SMS-based interface (for low-bandwidth areas).

The system greets the user and explains its purpose (e.g., "Welcome to the AI-Powered Mobile Clinic. How can we assist you today?").

Step 2: Authentication (Optional)

If the user is a returning patient, they can log in to access their medical history.

New users can proceed as guests or create an account for future use.

2. Symptom Analysis
Step 3: Symptom Input

The user describes their symptoms in natural language (e.g., "I have a fever and a sore throat").

The Symptom Analysis Agent engages in a dynamic conversation to gather more details:

Asks follow-up questions (e.g., "How long have you had the fever?" or "Do you have any difficulty swallowing?").

Uses NLP to understand the user’s responses.

Step 4: Preliminary Triage

The agent analyzes the symptoms using LLM-based models and provides a preliminary assessment:

Suggests whether the condition is urgent, non-urgent, or self-manageable.

Provides basic advice (e.g., "You may have a viral infection. Please monitor your symptoms and stay hydrated.").

3. Telehealth Integration
Step 5: Practitioner Matching

If the user needs further consultation, the Telehealth Coordination Agent takes over:

Matches the user with an available healthcare practitioner based on:

Symptoms (e.g., dermatologist for skin issues).

Location (e.g., local practitioners for in-person visits if needed).

Availability (e.g., real-time video consultations).

Sends a notification to the practitioner with the user’s symptom summary.

Step 6: Real-Time Consultation

The user is connected to the practitioner via audio/video call.

During the consultation:

The Patient History Agent provides the practitioner with the user’s medical history (if available).

The Symptom Analysis Agent shares the preliminary assessment for reference.

4. Prescription and Treatment Plan
Step 7: Prescription Drafting

After the consultation, the Prescription Drafting Agent generates a draft treatment plan:

Suggests medications, dosages, and follow-up instructions.

Cross-checks for drug interactions or contraindications.

The practitioner reviews and approves the draft.

Step 8: User Notification

The user receives the finalized treatment plan via the app, SMS, or email.

The plan includes:

Medication details (e.g., "Take paracetamol 500mg every 6 hours").

Follow-up instructions (e.g., "Return in 3 days if symptoms persist").

Referrals (if needed, e.g., "Visit a cardiologist for further evaluation").

5. Follow-Up and Monitoring
Step 9: Follow-Up Reminders

The Follow-Up and Monitoring Agent sends reminders to the user:

Medication reminders (e.g., "Time to take your next dose of paracetamol").

Follow-up appointment reminders (e.g., "Your next consultation is in 3 days").

Step 10: Progress Tracking

The user can report their progress (e.g., "My fever has gone down, but I still have a sore throat").

The agent monitors these updates and flags any concerning trends to the practitioner.

6. Emergency Handling (If Needed)
Step 11: Emergency Detection

If the user reports critical symptoms (e.g., chest pain, difficulty breathing), the Emergency Response Agent takes over:

Immediately escalates the case to emergency services.

Provides real-time guidance to the user (e.g., "Please sit down and try to stay calm. Help is on the way.").

Step 12: Data Sharing with Emergency Services

The agent shares the user’s symptom summary, location, and medical history with emergency responders.

7. Post-Visit Feedback
Step 13: User Feedback

After the consultation, the user is prompted to provide feedback on their experience:

Rate the system (e.g., "How satisfied are you with the service?").

Suggest improvements (e.g., "What could we do better?").

Step 14: System Improvement

The feedback is used to improve the AI models and user experience.

###Agents:
Elaboration of the Problem Statement
1. LLM-Based Symptom Analysis
Problem: In many healthcare systems, especially in underserved or rural areas, patients often face delays in receiving initial medical advice. This can lead to worsening conditions or unnecessary visits to overcrowded hospitals.

Solution: Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patient-reported symptoms and provide quick, accurate triage suggestions. The AI can ask follow-up questions to refine its understanding and offer preliminary advice on whether the patient needs urgent care, can wait, or can manage the condition at home.

Agentic AI Integration:

A symptom analysis agent can handle the conversation with the patient, dynamically adjusting its questions based on the patient's responses.

This agent can also integrate with medical databases to ensure its suggestions are up-to-date and evidence-based.
